# 2D examples used in the paper

Install `sair` to run the examples.

Folder names of the inversion results organized as follows:

- cc -> $CC^{all}$
- cc_rec -> $CC^{all}_{rec}$
- dd -> $CC^{DD}$
- cc+dd -> $CC^{DD}+CC^{single}$
- cc_and_dd -> $CC^{DD}+CC^{all}$
- cc_and_dd_with_ccrec -> $CC^{DD}+CC^{all}_{rec}$


## Pair Weight Test

Includes CC, Unweighted DD, Weighted DD runs.

## 2D Global Phase Model

2D Phase Velocity Model inversions.

## 2D Guernica Inversions

Includes both CC and WF.

## Regional Test

Example in the Appendix A to show the effect of the pairing parameters
and weights in a regional setting.
